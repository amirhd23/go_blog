# How to Boil an Egg

Boiling eggs is a simple and versatile cooking method. Whether you like them soft or hard-boiled, here's a step-by-step guide to get perfectly boiled eggs every time.

## Ingredients
- Eggs (as many as you want to boil)
- Water

## Equipment
- Saucepan or pot
- Stove
- Timer
- Ice bath (optional, for easy peeling)

## Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Pot
1. Fill a saucepan or pot with enough water to cover the eggs by about an inch or so.
2. Place the pot on the stove and bring the water to a rolling boil over high heat.

### 2. Add the Eggs
1. Once the water is boiling, gently lower the eggs into the water using a spoon or a ladle to avoid cracking the shells.
2. Reduce the heat to medium-high to maintain a gentle boil.

### 3. Set the Timer
- **Soft-Boiled Eggs:** Boil for 4-6 minutes.
  - The whites will be set, but the yolks will be slightly runny.
- **Medium-Boiled Eggs:** Boil for 7-9 minutes.
  - The whites will be firm, and the yolks will be mostly set with a slightly creamy center.
- **Hard-Boiled Eggs:** Boil for 10-12 minutes.
  - The yolks will be fully cooked and crumbly.

### 4. Prepare an Ice Bath (Optional)
1. While the eggs are boiling, prepare a bowl of ice water.
2. Once the eggs reach your desired doneness, carefully transfer them to the ice bath to cool for a few minutes. This stops the cooking process and makes peeling easier.

### 5. Peel and Serve
1. Gently tap the eggs on a hard surface to crack the shell.
2. Peel the shell off, starting at the wide end where thereâ€™s often an air pocket.
3. Rinse the peeled eggs under cold water to remove any bits of shell.

## Tips
- **Fresh Eggs:** Fresh eggs are harder to peel. If possible, use eggs that are a week or so old.
- **Cooking Time:** Adjust the cooking time slightly based on the size of the eggs and altitude.

## Storage
- Boiled eggs can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one week. Keep them in their shells until you're ready to eat them for the best freshness.

Enjoy your perfectly boiled eggs!
